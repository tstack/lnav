These tutorials are provided to help you learn how **lnav** works
without having to install anything.  They are running on a shared
[fly.io](https://fly.io) instance, so please be kind.

The tutorials are implemented using features in **lnav** and not
built in to the code itself.  The tutorial text is
[markdown](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/ui.html#markdown),
the logic is written in [SQL](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/sqlext.html),
and the reactions are triggered through
[events](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/events.html).

The source for the tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/tstack/lnav/tree/master/docs/tutorials).
