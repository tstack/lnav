%description
The Logfile Navigator, lnav for short, is a curses-based tool for viewing and
analyzing log files. The value added by lnav over text viewers or editors is
that it takes advantage of any semantic information that can be gleaned from
the log file, such as timestamps and log levels. Using this extra semantic
information, lnav can do things like interleaving messages from different
files, generate histograms of messages over time, and provide hotkeys for
navigating through the file. These features are meant to allow the user to
quickly and efficiently focus on problems.
