/**
 * VT52 emulator for curses, useful for mediating between curses and readline,
 * which don't play well together.  It is expected that a subclass of this
 * class will fork off a child process that sends and receives VT52 keycodes(?)
 * which is translated by this class into curses calls.
 *
 * VT52 seems to be the simplest terminal to emulate since we do not need to
 * maintain the state of the screen, beyond past lines.  For example, when
 * inserting a character, VT52 moves the cursor to the insertion point, clears
 * the rest of the line and then rewrites the rest of the line with the new
 * character.  This is in contrast to VT100 which moves the cursor to the
 * insertion point and then sends a code to insert the character and relying
 * on the terminal to shift the rest of the line to the right a character.
