lnav v0.8.2:
     Features:
     * The timestamp format for JSON log files can be specified with the
       "timestamp-format" option in the "line-format" array.
     * Added "min-width", "max-width", "align", and "overflow" options to the
       "line-format" in format definitions for JSON log files.  These options
       give you more control over how the displayed line looks.
     * Added a "hidden" option to log format values so that you can hide JSON
       log fields from being displayed if they are not in the line format.
     * Added a "rewriter" field to log format value definitions that is a
       command used to rewrite the field in the pretty-printed version of a
       log message.  For example, the HTTP access log format will rewrite the
       status code field to include the textual version (e.g. 200 (OK)).
     * Log message fields can now be hidden using the :hide-fields" command or
       by setting the 'hidden' property in the log format.  When hidden, the
       fields will be replaced with a yellow ellipsis when displayed.  Hiding
       large fields that contain extra details can make the log easier to read.
       The 'x' hotkey can be used to quickly toggle whether these fields are
       displayed or not.
     * Added a ':mark' command to bookmark the top line in the current view.
     * Added an ':alt-msg' command that can be used to set the text to be
       displayed in the bottom right of the command line.  This command is
       mostly intended for use by hotkey maps to set the help text.
     * In lnav scripts, the first row of a SQL query result will now be turned
       into local variables that can be referenced in other commands or
       queries.  For example, the following script will print the number one:
         ;SELECT 1 as foobar
         :eval :echo ${foobar}
     * Added an 'lnav_view_stack' SQL table that gives access to the view
       stack.
     * Added a 'top_time' column to the lnav_views table so that you can get
       the timestamp for the top line in views that are time-based as well as
       allowing you to move the view to a given time with an UPDATE statement.
     * Added a 'search' column to the lnav_views table so that you can perform
       a text search programmatically.
     * Added a 'regexp_capture(<string>, <pattern>)' table-valued function for
       getting detailed results from matching a regular expression against a
       string.
     * Added a 'timediff(<time1>, <time2>)' SQL function for computing the
       difference between two relative or absolute timestamps.
     * Log formats can now define a default set of highlights with the
       "highlights" property.
     * Added a '|search-for <pattern>' built-in script that can be used to
       start a search from the command-line.
     * Log format definitions can now specify the expected log level for a
       sample line.  This check should make it easier to validate the
       definition.

     Interface Changes:
     * Command and SQL documentation is now displayed in a section at the
       bottom of the screen when a command or query is being entered.  Some
       commands will also display a preview of the command results.  For
       example, the ':open' command will display the first ten lines of the
       file to be opened and the ':filter-out' command will highlight text
       that matches in the current view.  The preview pane can be shown/hidden
       by pressing CTRL-P.
     * The color used for text colored via ":highlight" is now based on the
       the regex instead of randomly picked so that colors are consistent
       across invocations.
     * The "graph" view has been removed since it's functionality has been
       obsoleted by other features, like ":create-search-table".
     * When doing a search, if a hit is found within a second after hitting
       <ENTER>, the view will move to the matched line.  The previous behavior
       was to stay on the current line, which tended to be a surprise to new
       users.
     * Pressing 'n'/'N' to move through the next/previous search hit will now
       skip adjacent lines, up to the vertical size of the view.  This should
       make scanning through clusters of hits much faster.  Repeatedly
       pressing these keys within a short time will also accelerate scanning
       by moving the view at least a full page at a time.

     Breaking Changes:
     * The captured timestamp text in log files must fully match a known format
       or an error will be reported.  The previous behavior was to ignore any
       text at the end of the line.

     Fixes:
     * You can now execute commands from the standard input by using a dash (-)
       with the '-f' command-line argument.  Reading commands from a file
       descriptor should also work, for example, with the following bash
       syntax:

           $ lnav -f <(echo :open the-file-to-open)
     * Programming language syntax highlighting should now only be applied to
       source code files instead of everywhere.

lnav v0.8.1:
     Features:
     * Added a spectrogram command and view that displays the values of a
       numeric field over time.  The view works for log message fields or
       for database result columns.
     * Log formats can now create SQL views and execute other statements
       by adding '.sql' files to their format directories.  The SQL scripts
       will be executed on startup.
     * Added 'json_group_object' and 'json_group_array' aggregate SQL
       functions that collects values from a GROUP BY query into a JSON
       object or array, respectively.
     * The SQL view will now graph values found in JSON objects/arrays in
       addition to the regular columns in the result.
     * Added an 'regexp_match(<re>, <str>)' SQL function that can be used to
       extract values from a string using a regular expression.
     * Added an 'extract(<str>)' SQL function that extracts values using the
       same data discover/extraction parser used in the 'logline' table.
     * Added a "summary" overlay line to the bottom of the log view that
       displays how long ago the last message was received, along with the
       total number of files and the error rate over the past five minutes.
     * Pressing 'V' in the DB view will now check for a column with a
       timestamp and move to the corresponding time in the log view.
     * Added 'a/A' hotkeys to restore a view previously popped with 'q/Q'.
     * Added ":hide-lines-before", ":hide-lines-after", and
       ":show-lines-before-and-after" commands so that you can filter out
       log lines based on time.
     * Scripts containing lnav commands/queries can now be executed using
       the pipe ('|') hotkey.  See the documentation for more information.
     * Added an ":eval" command that can be used to execute a command or
       query after performing environment variable substitution.
     * Added an ":echo" command that can be useful for scripts to message
       the user.
     * The "log_part" column can now be set with an SQL UPDATE statement.
     * Added a "log_body" hidden column that returns the body of the log
       message.
     * Added ":config", ":reset-config", and ":save-config" commands to change
       configuration options, reset to default, and save them for future
       executions.
     * Added a "/ui/clock-format" configuration option that controls the time
       format in the top-left corner.
     * Added a "/ui/dim-text" configuration option that controls the brightness
       of text in the UI.
     * Added support for TAI64 timestamps (http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html).
     * Added a safe execution mode. If the 'LNAVSECURE' environment variable is
       set before executing lnav, the following commands are disabled:
       - open
       - pipe-to
       - pipe-line-to
       - write-*-to
       This makes it easier to run lnav with escalated privileges in restricted
       environments, without the risk of users being able to use the above
       mentioned commands to gain privileged access.

     Interface Changes:
     * The 'o/O' hotkeys have been reassigned to navigate through log
       messages that have a matching "opid" field.  The old action of
       moving forward and backward by 60 minutes can be simulated by
       using the ':goto' command with a relative time and the 'r/R'
       hotkeys.
     * Log messages with timestamps that pre-date previous log messages will
       have the timestamp highlighted in yellow and underlined.  These out-
       of-time-order messages will be assigned the time of the previous
       message for sorting purposes.  You can press the 'p' hotkey to examine
       the 'Received Time' of the message as well as the time parsed from the
       original message.  A "log_actual_time" hidden field has also been
       added to the SQLite virtual table so you can operate on the original
       message time from the file.
     * The 'A/B' hotkeys for moving forward/backward by 10% line increments
       have been reassigned to '[' and ']'.  The 'a' and 'A' hotkeys are now
       used to return to the previously popped view while trying to preserve
       the time range.  For example, after leaving the spectrogram view with
       'q', you can press 'A' return to the view with the top time in the
       spectrogram matching the top time in the log view.
     * The 'Q' hotkey now pops the current view off of the stack while
       maintaining the top time between views.

     Fixes:
     * Issues with tailing JSON logs have been fixed.
     * The jget() SQL function should now work for objects nested in arrays.

lnav v0.8.0:
     Features:
     * Integration with "papertrailapp.com" for querying and tailing
       server log and syslog messages.  See the Papertrail section in
       the online help for more details.
     * Remote files can be opened when lnav is built with libcurl v7.23.0+
     * SQL queries can now be done on lines that match a regular expression
       using the "log_search" table or by creating custom tables with the
       ":create-search-table" command.
     * Log formats that are "containers" for other log formats, like
       syslog, are now supported.  See the online help for more
       information.
     * Formats can be installed from git repositories using the '-i' option.
       A standard set of extra formats can be installed by doing
       'lnav -i extra'. (You must have git installed for this to work.)
     * Added support for 'VMware vSphere Auto Deploy' log format.
     * Added a 'sudo' log format.
     * Added hotkeys to move left/right by a smaller increment (H/L or
       Shift+Left/Shift+Right).
     * A color-coded bar has been added to the left side to show where
       messages from one file stop and messages from another file start.
     * The '-C' option will now try to check any specified log files to
       make sure the format(s) match all of the lines.
     * Added an "all_logs" SQLite table that contains the message format
       extracted from each log line.  Also added a ';.msgformat' SQL command
       that executes a query that returns the counts for each format and the
       first line where the format was seen.
     * Added an "lnav_views" SQLite table that can be used to query and
       change the lnav view state.
     * When typing in a command, the status bar will display a short
       summary of the currently entered command.
     * Added a "delete-filter" command.
     * Added a "log_msg_instance" column to the logline and log_search
       tables to make it easier to join tables that are matching log
       messages that are ordered.
     * Added a "timeslice()" function to SQLite so that it is easier to
       group log messages by time buckets.
     * The 'goto' command now supports relative time values like
       'a minute ago', 'an hour later', and many more.

     Interface Changes:
     * The 'r/R' hotkeys have been reassigned to navigate through the log
       messages by the relative time value that was last used with the
       'goto' command.

     Fixes:
     * The pretty-print view should now work for text files.
     * Nested fields in JSON logs are now supported for levels, bodies, etc...
     * Tab-completion should work for quoted SQL identifiers.
     * 'lo-fi' mode key shortcut changed to CTRL+L.
     * 'redraw' shortcut removed. Relegated to just a command.
     * Fixed lnav hang in pretty-print mode while doing a dns lookup.
     * The generic log message parser used to extract data has been
       optimized and should be a bit faster.

lnav v0.7.3:
     Features:
     * Add 'pipe-to' and 'pipe-line-to' commands that pipe the currently
       marked lines or the current log message to a shell command,
       respectively.
     * Added a "pretty-print" view (P hotkey) that tries to reformat log
       messages so that they are easier to read.
     * Added a 'redraw' command (CTRL+L hotkey) to redraw the window in
       case it has been corrupted.
     * Added a 'relative-goto' command to move the current view relative
       to its current position.
     * Experimental support for linking with jemalloc.
     * The plain text view now supports filtering.
     * Added 'next-mark' and 'prev-mark' commands to jump to the next or
       previous bookmarked line (e.g. error, warning, ...)
     * Added a 'zoom-to' command to change the zoom level of the histogram
       view.
     * Log formats can now define their own timestamp formats with the
       'timestamp-format' field.

     Fixes:
     * Autotools scripts overhaul.
     * Added a configure option to disable linking with libtinfo. The newer
       versions of ncurses don't require it, however the build silently pulls
       it in as a dependency, if it is available on the system. This can be
       explicitly disabled using the '--disable-tinfo' option during configure.
     * Fixed the configure script behavior to ignore the values specified using
       the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables while searching for sqlite3
       when '--with-sqlite3' switch was specified without the prefix.
     * The configure script now recognizes libeditline symlink'ed to masquerade
       as libreadline. This previously used to cause problems at compile time,
       specially on OS X. If you come across this error, use the
       '--with-readline=prefix' switch to specify the path to the correct
       location of libreadline.
     * The order that log formats are tried against a log file is now
       automatically determined so that more specific formats are tested
       before more general ones.  The order is determined on startup based on
       how each format matches each other formats sample lines.
     * Command files (i.e. those executed via the '-f' flag) now support
       commands/queries that span more than one line.
     * Added more log levels: stats, debug2 - debug5.

lnav v0.7.2:
     * Added log formats for vdsm, openstack, and the vmkernel.
     * Added a "lo-fi" mode (L hotkey) that dumps the displayed log lines
       to the terminal without any decorations.  The write-to, write-json-to,
       and write-csv-to commands will also write their output to the terminal
       when passed '-' as the file name.  This mode can be useful for copying
       plain text lines to the clipboard.
     * (OS X) Text search strings are copied to the system's "find" clipboard.
       Also, when starting a new search, the current value in the "find"
       clipboard can be tab-completed.

lnav v0.7.1:
     Features:
     * Added an 'environ' SQL table that reflects lnav's environment
       variables.  The table can be read and written to using SQL
       SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.  Setting variables
       can be a way to use SQL query results in lnav commands.
     * Added a 'jget' SQLite function that can extract fields from a JSON-
       encoded value.
     * Added log formats for the OpenAM identity provider.
     * Added a 'clear-highlight' command to clear previous calls to the
       'highlight' command.
     * Fixed some performance bugs in indexing JSON log formats.  Loading
       times should be at least five times faster.
     * Filtering performance should be improved so that enabling/disabling
       filters should be almost instantaneous.
     * The filter-in, filter-out, and highlight commands now support
       tab-completion of text in the current view.
     * Add a '-i' flag that installs format files in: ~/.lnav/formats/installed

lnav v0.7.0:
     Features:
     * Add the '.schema' SQL command to open a view that displays the schema
       for the internal tables and any attached databases.  If lnav was only
       executed with a SQLite database and no text files, this view will open
       by default.
     * The scroll bar now indicates the location of errors/warnings, search
       hits, and bookmarks.
     * The xterm title is update to reflect the file name for the top line
       in the view.
     * Added a "headless" mode so that you can execute commands and run SQL
       queries from the command-line without having to do it from the curses
       UI.
     * When doing a search or SQL query, any text that is currently being
       displayed can be tab-completed.
     * The '-H' option was added so you can view the internal help text.
     * Added the 'g/G' hotkeys to move to the top/bottom of the file.
     * Added a 'log_mark' column to the log tables that indicates whether or
       not a log message is bookmarked.  The field is writable, so you can
       bookmark lines using an SQL UPDATE query.
     * Added syntax-highlighting when editing SQL queries or search regexes.
     * Added a "write-json-to" command that writes the result of a SQL query
       to a JSON-formatted file.
     * The "elapsed time" column now uses red/green coloring to indicate
       sharp changes in the message rate.
     * Added a "set-min-log-level" command to filter out log messages that
       are below a given level.

     Fixes:
     * Performance improvements.
     * Multi-line filtering has been fixed.
     * A collator has been added to the log_level column in the log tables
       so that you can write expressions like "log_level > 'warning'".
     * The log_time datetime format now matches what is returned by
       "datetime('now')" so that collating works correctly.
     * If a search string is not valid PCRE syntax, a search is done for
       the exact string instead of just returning an error.
     * Static-linking has been cleaned up.
     * OpenSSL is no longer a requirement.
     * Alpha support for Windows/cygwin.
     * Environment variables can now be accessed in SQL queries using
       the syntax: $VAR_NAME
     * An internal log is kept and written out on a crash.
     * Partition bookmarks are now tracked separately from regular user
       bookmarks.  You can start a partition with the 'partition-name'
       command and remove it with the 'clear-partition' command.
     * Improved display of possible matches during tab-completion in the
       command-prompt.  The matches are now shown in a separate view and
       pressing tab repeatedly will scroll through the view.
     * The "open" command now does shell word expansion for file names.
     * More config directory paths have been added: /etc/lnav,
       $prefix/etc/lnav, and directories passed on the command-line with -I.

lnav v0.6.2:
     Features:
     * Word-wrap support.

     Fixes:
     * Fix some OS X Mavericks build/runtime issues.

lnav v0.6.1:
     Features:
     * Support for JSON-encoded log files.

     Fixes:
     * Some minor fixes and performance improvements.

lnav v0.6.0:
     Features:
     * Custom log formats and more builtin formats
     * Automatic extraction of data from logs
     * UI improvements, support for 256 color terminals

lnav v0.5.1:
     Features:
     * Added the '-t' and '-w' options which can be used to prepend a
       timestamp to any data piped in on stdin and to specify a file to
       write the contents of stdin to.

     Fixes:
     * Cleanup for packaging.

lnav v0.5.0:
     Features:
     * Files can be specified on the command-line using wildcards so that
       new files are automatically loaded.  Directories can also be passed
       as command-line arguments to read all of the files in the directory.
     * Builds on cygwin again.
     * Added the 'C' hotkey to clear any existing user bookmarks.
     * Added experimental support for accepting input from mice.

     Fixes:
     * Internal cleanup.
     * Copying to the clipboard on OS X is now supported.
     * Many bug fixes.

lnav v0.4.0:
     Features:
     * Files that are not recognized as containing log messages have been
       broken out to a separate text files view.  You can flip between the
       log view and the text file view with the 't' hotkey.  When viewing
       text files, the 'f' hotkey will switch between files.
     * Files compressed with bzip2 are recognized and decompressed on the
       fly.
     * Added a "session" file and command for storing commands that should
       be executed on startup.  For example, if you always want some
       highlighting to be done, you can add that command to the session
       file.

     Fixes:
     * Add some more log file formats for generic log files.
     * Performance improvements for compressed files.
     * Works on OS X now.

lnav v0.3.0:
     Changes:
     * The hotkey for the SQL view was changed to 'v' and 'V' from '.'.

     Features:
     * You can now switch between the SQL result view and the log view while
       keeping the top of the views in sync with the "line_number" column.

     Fixes:
     * The "line_number" column is no longer included in the SQL result view's
       stacked bar graph.
     * Added a "warnings" count to the histogram view.
