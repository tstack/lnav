[1m[35mlnav[0m

A fancy log file viewer for the terminal.

[1mOverview[0m

The Logfile Navigator, [1mlnav[0m, is an enhanced log file viewer that takes
advantage of any semantic information that can be gleaned from the
files being viewed, such as timestamps and log levels. Using this
extra semantic information, lnav can do things like interleaving
messages from different files, generate histograms of messages over
time, and providing hotkeys for navigating through the file. It is
hoped that these features will allow the user to quickly and
efficiently zero in on problems.

[1mOpening Paths/URLs[0m

The main arguments to lnav are the local/remote files, directories,
glob patterns, or URLs to be viewed. If no arguments are given, the
default syslog file for your system will be opened. These arguments
will be polled periodically so that any new data or files will be
automatically loaded. If a previously loaded file is removed or
replaced, it will be closed and the replacement opened.

Note: When opening SFTP URLs, if the password is not provided for the
host, the SSH agent can be used to do authentication.

[1mOptions[0m

Lnav takes a list of files to view and/or you can use the flag
arguments to load well-known log files, such as the syslog log files.
The flag arguments are:

 [33m•[0m [37m[40m -a [0m Load all of the most recent log file types.
 [33m•[0m [37m[40m -r [0m Recursively load files from the given directory
   hierarchies.
 [33m•[0m [37m[40m -R [0m Load older rotated log files as well.

When using the flag arguments, lnav will look for the files relative
to the current directory and its parent directories. In other words,
if you are working within a directory that has the well-known log
files, those will be preferred over any others.

If you do not want the default syslog file to be loaded when no files
are specified, you can pass the [37m[40m -N [0m flag.

Any files given on the command-line are scanned to determine their log
file format and to create an index for each line in the file. You do
not have to manually specify the log file format. The currently
supported formats are: syslog, apache, strace, tcsh history, and
generic log files with timestamps.

Lnav will also display data piped in on the standard input.

To automatically execute queries or lnav commands after the files have
been loaded, you can use the following options:

 [33m•[0m [37m[40m -c cmd [0m A command, query, or file to execute. The
   first character determines the type of operation: a colon
   ([37m[40m : [0m) is used for the built-in commands; a semi-colon (
   [37m[40m ; [0m) for SQL/PRQL queries; and a pipe symbol ([37m[40m | [0m) for
   executing a file containing other commands. For example,
   to open the file "foo.log" and go to the tenth line in
   the file, you can do:
   
    ▌[37m[40mlnav -c [0m[35m[40m':goto 10'[0m[37m[40m foo.log              [0m
   
   This option can be given multiple times to execute
   multiple operations in sequence.
 [33m•[0m [37m[40m -f file [0m A file that contains commands, queries, or
   files to execute. This option is a shortcut for
   [37m[40m -c '|file' [0m. You can use a dash ([37m[40m - [0m) to execute
   commands from the standard input.

To execute commands/queries without opening the interactive text UI,
you can pass the [37m[40m -n [0m option. This combination of options allows you
to write scripts for processing logs with lnav. For example, to get a
list of IP addresses that dhclient has bound to in CSV format:

 ▌[32m[40m#! /usr/bin/lnav -nf                                                                            [0m

[1mDisplay[0m

The main part of the display shows the log lines from the files
interleaved based on time-of-day. New lines are automatically loaded
as they are appended to the files and, if you are viewing the bottom
of the files, lnav will scroll down to display the new lines, much
like [37m[40m tail -f [0m.

On color displays, the lines will be highlighted as follows:

 [33m•[0m Errors will be colored in [31mred[0m;
 [33m•[0m warnings will be [33myellow[0m;
 [33m•[0m boundaries between days will be [4munderlined[0m; and
 [33m•[0m various color highlights will be applied to: IP
   addresses, SQL keywords, XML tags, file and line numbers
   in Java backtraces, and quoted strings.

To give you an idea of where you are spatially, the right side of the
display has a proportionally sized 'scroll bar' that indicates your
current position in the files. The scroll bar will also show areas of
the file where warnings or errors are detected by coloring the bar
yellow or red, respectively. Tick marks will also be added to the left
and right-hand side of the bar, for search hits and bookmarks.

The bar on the left side indicates the file the log message is from. A
break in the bar means that the next log message comes from a
different file. The color of the bar is derived from the file name.
Pressing the left-arrow or [37m[40m h [0m will reveal the source file names for
each message and pressing again will show the full paths.

Above and below the main body are status lines that display a variety
of information. The top line displays:

 [33m•[0m The current time, configurable by the
   [37m[40m /ui/clock-format [0m property.
 [33m•[0m The highest priority message from the
   [37m[40m lnav_user_notifications [0m table. You can insert rows into
   this table to display your own status messages. The
   default message displayed on startup explains how to
   focus on the next status line at the top, which is an
   interactive breadcrumb bar.

The second status line at the top display breadcrumbs for the top line
in the main view. Pressing [37m[40m ENTER [0m will focus input on the breadcrumb
bar, the cursor keys can be used to select a breadcrumb. The common
breadcrumbs are:

 [33m•[0m The name of the current view.
 [33m•[0m In the log view, the timestamp of the top log message.
 [33m•[0m In the log view, the format of the log file the top
   log message is from.
 [33m•[0m The name of the file the top line was pulled from.
 [33m•[0m If the top line is within a larger chunk of structured
   data, the path to the value in the top line will be
   shown.

Notes:

 [33m1.[0m Pressing [37m[40m CTRL-A [0m/[37m[40m CTRL-E [0m will select the
    first/last breadcrumb.
 [33m2.[0m Typing text while a breadcrumb is selected will
    perform a fuzzy search on the possibilities.

The bottom status bar displays:

 [33m•[0m The line number for the top line in the display.
 [33m•[0m The current search hit, the total number of hits, and
   the search term.

If the view supports filtering, there will be a status line showing
the following:

 [33m•[0m The number of enabled filters and the total number of
   filters.
 [33m•[0m The number of lines not displayed because of
   filtering.

To edit the filters, you can press TAB to change the focus from the
main view to the filter editor. The editor allows you to create,
enable/disable, and delete filters easily.

Along with filters, a "Files" panel will also be available for viewing
and controlling the files that lnav is currently monitoring.

Finally, the last line on the display is where you can enter search
patterns and execute internal commands, such as converting a
unix-timestamp into a human-readable date. The prompt has emacs-like
keyboard shortcuts that can be used for editing and moving within the
command-line.

The body of the display is also used to display other content, such
as: the help file, histograms of the log messages over time, and SQL
results. The views are organized into a stack so that any time you
activate a new view with a key press or command, the new view is
pushed onto the stack. Pressing the same key again will pop the view
off of the stack and return you to the previous view. Note that you
can always use [37m[40m q [0m to pop the top view off of the stack.

                Sharp changes in the message rate are highlighted 
                by coloring the separator between the time column 
                and the log message. A red highlight means the    
                message rate has slowed down and green means it   
                has sped up. You can use the "s/S" hotkeys to scan

                layed out horizontally with colored segments      
                representing the different log levels. You can use
                the [37m[40m z [0m hotkey to change the size of the time

                switch to the log view and move to the line number
                that was selected in the "log_line" column. If

[1mLog Analysis[0m

Lnav has support for performing SQL queries on log files using the
SQLite3 "virtual" table feature. For all supported log file types,
lnav will create tables that can be queried using the subset of SQL
that is supported by SQLite3. For example, to get the top ten URLs
being accessed in any loaded Apache log files, you can execute:

The query result view shows the results and graphs any numeric values
found in the result, much like the histogram view.

The builtin set of log tables are listed below. Note that only the log
messages that match a particular format can be queried by a particular
table. You can find the file format and table name for the top log
message by looking in the upper right hand corner of the log file
view.

Some commonly used format tables are:

 Name         Description                                       
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 access_log   Apache common access log format                   
 syslog_log   Syslog format                                     
[1m strace_log   Strace log format                                 [0m
[1m generic_log  'Generic' log format. This table contains messages[0m
[1m              from files that have a very simple format with a  [0m
[1m              leading timestamp followed by the message.        [0m

NOTE: You can get a dump of the schema for the internal tables, and
any attached databases, by running the [37m[40m .schema [0m SQL command.

The columns available for the top log line in the view will
automatically be displayed after pressing the semicolon ([37m[40m ; [0m) key. All
log tables contain at least the following columns:

 Column          Description                                       
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 log_line        The line number in the file, starting at zero.    
 log_part        The name of the partition.  You can change this   
                 column using an UPDATE SQL statement or with the  
                 'partition-name' command.  After a value is set,  
                 the following log messages will have the same     
                 partition name up until another name is set.      
[1m log_time        The time of the log entry.                        [0m
[1m log_idle_msecs  The amount of time, in milliseconds, between the  [0m
[1m                 current log message and the previous one.         [0m
 log_level       The log level (e.g. info, error, etc...).         
 log_mark        The bookmark status for the line.  This column can
                 be written to using an UPDATE query.              
[1m log_path        The full path to the file.                        [0m
[1m log_text        The raw line of text.  Note that this column is   [0m
[1m                 not included in the result of a 'select *', but it[0m
[1m                 does exist.                                       [0m

These tables are created dynamically and not stored in memory or on
disk. If you would like to persist some information from the tables,
you can attach another database and create tables in that database.
For example, if you wanted to save the results from the earlier
example of a top ten query into the "{TMPDIR}topten.db" file, you can do:

[4mPRQL Support[0m

The Pipelined Relational Query Language ]8;;https://prql-lang.org\[4m(PRQL)[0m]8;;\¹ is an alternative
database query language that compiles to SQL.  The main advantage of
PRQL, in the context of lnav, is that it is easier to work with
interactively compared to SQL.  For example, lnav can provide previews
of different stages of the pipeline and provide more accurate
tab-completions for the columns in the result set.

 [34m▌[0m[1] - https://prql-lang.org 

You can execute a PRQL query in the SQL prompt.  A PRQL query starts
with the [37m[40m from [0m keyword that specifies the table to use as a data
source.  The next stage of a pipeline is started by entering a pipe
symbol ([37m[40m | [0m) followed by a ]8;;https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/stdlib/transforms/index.html\[4mPRQL transform[0m]8;;\¹. As you build the query in
the prompt, lnav will display any relevant help and preview for the
current and previous stages of the pipeline.

 [34m▌[0m[1] - https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/stdlib/transforms/index.html 

Using the top ten URLs query from earlier as an example, the PRQL
version would be as follows:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mfrom[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40maccess_log[0m[37m[40m | [0m[37m[40mstats.count_by[0m[37m[40m cs_uri_stem | [0m[1m[36m[40mtake[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[37m[40m10[0m[37m[40m    [0m

The first stage selects the data source, the web [37m[40m access_log [0m table in
this case.  The [37m[40m stats.count_by [0m transform is a convenience provided
by lnav that groups by the given column, counts the rows in each
group, and sorts by count in descending order.  The [37m[40m take 10 [0mturns
into the [37m[40m LIMIT 10 [0m.

[1mDynamic logline Table (experimental)[0m

(NOTE: This feature is still very new and not completely reliable yet,
use with care.)

For log formats that lack message structure, lnav can parse the log
message and attempt to extract any data fields that it finds. This
feature is available through the [37m[40m logline [0m log table. This table is
dynamically created and defined based on the message at the top of the
log view. For example, given the following log message from "sudo",
lnav will create the "logline" table with columns for "TTY", "PWD",
"USER", and "COMMAND":

 ▌[37m[40mMay 24 06:48:38 Tim-Stacks-iMac.local sudo[76387]: stack : TTY=ttys003 ; PWD=/Users/stack/github/lbuild ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/echo Hello, World!    [0m

Queries executed against this table will then only return results for
other log messages that have the same format. So, if you were to
execute the following query while viewing the above line, you might
get the following results:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40mUSER[0m[37m[40m,[0m[37m[40mCOMMAND[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mFROM[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40mlogline[0m[37m[40m;      [0m

 USER  COMMAND                   
═════════════════════════════════
 root  /bin/echo Hello, World!   
 mal   /bin/echo Goodbye, World! 

The log parser works by examining each message for key/value pairs
separated by an equal sign (=) or a colon (:). For example, in the
previous example of a "sudo" message, the parser sees the "USER=root"
string as a pair where the key is "USER" and the value is "root". If
no pairs can be found, then anything that looks like a value is
extracted and assigned a numbered column. For example, the following
line is from "dhcpd":

 ▌[37m[40mSep 16 22:35:57 drill dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:16:ce:54:4e:f3 via hme3    [0m

In this case, the lnav parser recognizes that "DHCPDISCOVER", the MAC
address and the "hme3" device name are values and not normal words.
So, it builds a table with three columns for each of these values. The
regular words in the message, like "from" and "via", are then used to
find other messages with a similar format.

If you would like to execute queries against log messages of different
formats at the same time, you can use the 'create-logline-table'
command to permanently create a table using the top line of the log
view as a template.

[1mOther SQL Features[0m

Environment variables can be used in SQL statements by prefixing the
variable name with a dollar-sign ($). For example, to read the value
of the [37m[40m HOME [0m variable, you can do:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40m$HOME[0m[37m[40m;                          [0m

To select the syslog messages that have a hostname field that is equal
to the [37m[40m HOSTNAME [0m variable:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[37m[40m*[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mFROM[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40msyslog_log[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mWHERE[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40mlog_hostname[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[37m[40m=[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40m$HOSTNAME[0m[37m[40m;    [0m

NOTE: Variable substitution is done for fields in the query and is not
a plain text substitution. For example, the following statement WILL
NOT WORK:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[37m[40m*[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mFROM[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40m$TABLE_NAME[0m[37m[40m; [0m[32m[40m-- Syntax error[0m[37m[40m    [0m

Access to lnav's environment variables is also available via the
"environ" table. The table has two columns (name, value) and can be
read and written to using SQL SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
statements. For example, to set the "FOO" variable to the value "BAR":

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mINSERT[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mINTO[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40menviron[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[35m[40m'FOO'[0m[37m[40m, [0m[35m[40m'BAR'[0m[37m[40m;    [0m

As a more complex example, you can set the variable "LAST" to the last
syslog line number by doing:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mINSERT[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mINTO[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40menviron[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[35m[40m'LAST'[0m[37m[40m, ([0m[1m[36m[40mSELECT[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[37m[40mmax[0m[37m[40m([0m[37m[40mlog_line[0m[37m[40m) [0m[1m[36m[40mFROM[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40msyslog_log[0m[37m[40m);    [0m

A delete will unset the environment variable:

 ▌[37m[40m;[0m[1m[36m[40mDELETE[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mFROM[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40menviron[0m[37m[40m [0m[1m[36m[40mWHERE[0m[37m[40m [0m[37m[40mname[0m[1m[37m[40m=[0m[35m[40m'LAST'[0m[37m[40m;    [0m

The table allows you to easily use the results of a SQL query in lnav
commands, which is especially useful when scripting lnav.
