     [1mecho[0m [[1m-n[0m] [[4mstring[0m [4m...[0m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mecho[0m utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
     (‚Äò¬†‚Äô) characters and followed by a newline (‚Äò\n‚Äô) character, to the
     standard output.

     The following option is available:

     [1m-n[0m    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be
           achieved by appending ‚Äò\c‚Äô to the end of the string, as is done by
           iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the
           effect of ‚Äò\c‚Äô are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
           (‚ÄúPOSIX.1‚Äù) as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for
           maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to
           suppress the newline character.

     Some shells may provide a builtin [1mecho[0m command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Most notably, the builtin [1mecho[0m in sh(1) does
     not accept the [1m-n[0m option.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.
