The standard Unix utilities are great for processing raw text lines,
however, they do not understand log messages.  Tail can watch multiple
files at a time, but it won't display messages in order by time and
you can't scroll backwards.  Grep will only find matching lines, but
won't return a full multi-line log message.  Less can only display a
single file at a time.  Also, none of these basic tools handle
compressed files.

[1mTry online before installing[0m

You can SSH into a demo node to play with lnav before installing.

The [35m"playground"[0m account starts lnav with a couple of log files as an
example:

[1mUsage[0m

Simply point [1mlnav[0m at the files or directories you want to monitor, it
will figure out the rest:

 ▌[33m[40m$ [0m[37m[40mlnav /path/to/file1 /path/to/dir ...    [0m

The [1mlnav[0m TUI will pop up right away and begin indexing the files.
Progress is displayed in the [35m"Files"[0m panel at the bottom. Once the
indexing has finished, the LOG view will display the log messages that
were recognized[^1]. You can then use the usual hotkeys to move around
the view (arrow keys or [37m[40m j [0m/[37m[40m k [0m/[37m[40m h [0m/[37m[40m l [0m to move down/up/left/right).

information.

view (reachable by pressing [37m[40m t [0m).

[4mUsage with [0m[4m[37m[40m systemd-journald [0m

On systems running [37m[40m systemd-journald [0m, you can use [37m[40m lnav [0m as the
pager:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl | lnav                     [0m

or in follow mode:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -f | lnav                  [0m

Since [37m[40m journalctl [0m's default output format omits the year, if you are
viewing logs which span multiple years you will need to change the
output format to include the year, otherwise [37m[40m lnav [0m gets confused:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -o short-iso | lnav        [0m

It is also possible to use [37m[40m journalctl [0m's json output format and
[37m[40m lnav [0mwill make use of additional fields such as PRIORITY and
_SYSTEMD_UNIT:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -o json | lnav             [0m

In case some MESSAGE fields contain special characters such as ANSI
color codes which are considered as unprintable by journalctl,
specifying [37m[40m journalctl [0m's [37m[40m -a [0m option might be preferable in order to
output those messages still in a non-binary representation:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -a -o json | lnav          [0m

If using systemd v236 or newer, the output fields can be limited to
the ones actually recognized by [37m[40m lnav [0m for increased efficiency:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -o json --output-fields=MESSAGE,PRIORITY,_PID,SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER,_SYSTEMD_UNIT | lnav    [0m

If your system has been running for a long time, for increased
efficiency you may want to limit the number of log lines fed into
[37m[40m lnav [0m, e.g. via [37m[40m journalctl [0m's [37m[40m -n [0m or [37m[40m --since=... [0m options.

In case of a persistent journal, you may want to limit the number of
log lines fed into [37m[40m lnav [0m via [37m[40m journalctl [0m's [37m[40m -b [0m option.
