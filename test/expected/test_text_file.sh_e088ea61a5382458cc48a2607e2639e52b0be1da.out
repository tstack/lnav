[1mUsage[0m

The only file installed is the executable, [37m[40m lnav [0m.  You can execute it
with no arguments to view the default set of files:

 ▌[37m[40m$ lnav                                  [0m

You can view all the syslog messages by running:

 ▌[37m[40m$ lnav /var/log/messages*               [0m

[4mUsage with [0m[4m[37m[40m systemd-journald [0m

On systems running [37m[40m systemd-journald [0m, you can use [37m[40m lnav [0m as the
pager:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl | lnav                     [0m

or in follow mode:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -f | lnav                  [0m

Since [37m[40m journalctl [0m's default output format omits the year, if you are
viewing logs which span multiple years you will need to change the
output format to include the year, otherwise [37m[40m lnav [0m gets confused:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -o short-iso | lnav        [0m

It is also possible to use [37m[40m journalctl [0m's json output format and [37m[40m lnav[0m
will make use of additional fields such as PRIORITY and _SYSTEMD_UNIT:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -o json | lnav             [0m

In case some MESSAGE fields contain special characters such as ANSI
color codes which are considered as unprintable by journalctl,
specifying [37m[40m journalctl [0m's [37m[40m -a [0m option might be preferable in order to
output those messages still in a non-binary representation:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -a -o json | lnav          [0m

If using systemd v236 or newer, the output fields can be limited to
the ones actually recognized by [37m[40m lnav [0m for increased efficiency:

 ▌[37m[40m$ journalctl -o json --output-fields=MESSAGE,PRIORITY,_PID,SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER,_SYSTEMD_UNIT | lnav    [0m

If your system has been running for a long time, for increased
efficiency you may want to limit the number of log lines fed into [37m[40m lnav[0m
, e.g. via [37m[40m journalctl [0m's [37m[40m -n [0m or [37m[40m --since=... [0m options.

In case of a persistent journal, you may want to limit the number of
log lines fed into [37m[40m lnav [0m via [37m[40m journalctl [0m's [37m[40m -b [0m option.

software:

Run [37m[40m ./autogen.sh [0m if compiling from a cloned repository.

 ▌[33m[40m$ [0m[37m[40m./configure                           [0m
 ▌[33m[40m$ [0m[37m[40mmake                                  [0m

command-line. If you're familiar with the SumoLogic query language,
you might find this tool more comfortable to work with.
